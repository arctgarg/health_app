flask health app

To run : 
python run.py

Current pending work:
need to add authorization. Explored flask-user, flask-login extensions for that. Could not find proper help.

https://flask-user.readthedocs.io/en/latest/authorization.html gives some functionality, but i could not understand how to use it. 
I need json response, i think this returns html by defualt.


I found this today morning. Need to take a look.
